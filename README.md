## Google Drive File Stream

_This package is automatically updated using [AU](https://github.com/majkinetor/au)._

> Introducing Drive File Stream — a new way to access all of your Google Drive files directly from your Mac or PC, without using up all your disk space. Unlike traditional file sync tools, Drive File Stream doesn’t require you to download your files first in order to access them from your computer. Instead, when you need to view or edit a file, it automatically streams from the cloud, on-demand. With Drive File Stream, your team will spend less time waiting for files to sync, no time worrying about disk space, and more time being productive.

To install Bing Desktop, run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell:

`choco install google-drive-file-stream`

## NVIDIA PhysX Legacy System Software

> This installer is required for games released around the end of 2007. If a game released in that period worked correctly with PhysX System Software 9.12.0613 but no longer works with latter versions the legacy installer is required. This will be a onetime install. No future updates are expected since these games do not support GPU acceleration and do not require updates for future GPUs. Supports NVIDIA PhysX acceleration on GeForce for SDK versions 2.7.0 and prior as well as 2.7.2.

To install NVIDIA PhysX Legacy System Software, run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell:

`choco install physx.legacy`
